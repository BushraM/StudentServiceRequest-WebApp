# StudentServiceRequest-WebApp

Asp.net web application which enables program coordinators to efficiently manage requests from students

A new service request can be created by the coordinator, or by the student. A coordinator will be able to work 
with a list of requests, and then select a request for processing. After the request has been resolved, 
the service request is marked as ‘completed’. Although a coordinator will work mostly with students from 
their own program(s), the coordinator must be able to process a request from a student in any program.
